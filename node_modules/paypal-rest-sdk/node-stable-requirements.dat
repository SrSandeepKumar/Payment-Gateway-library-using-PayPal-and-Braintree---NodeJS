Node 1.0.0 Release Plan

- New features (webhooks(2.0)? orders? payouts? vault-patch, url-validation, activate for subscriptions ?, more boilerplate for subscriptions, )
- node sdk stable release work + separated out api resources into their own classes + rest methods shared rather than duplicated everywhere + modules with their own responsibilities such as api and http client + following node and javascript conventions for naming conventions and debugging + major change so fix on tests and samples â€” regeneration of mock data to support name changes

improve modularity and sharing of rest endpoints while maintaining the lean structure of the sdk which is returns a object literal, so do worries with creating new objects or
- somethings already done, mock mode for testing, rest factory methods
- Refactors (single monolithic js file, using the same get/post ... instead of object oriented, implements in)
- Closing of existing issues (https://github.com/paypal/rest-api-sdk-nodejs/issues/34, https://github.com/paypal/rest-api-sdk-nodejs/issues/35)
- Build improvements (grunt/nock with commit, githook linting, autolinting tool)
- Testing improvements (add more tests for common use cases, e.g. partial capture in auth, global config issue live, sandbox, auto mock test generation)
