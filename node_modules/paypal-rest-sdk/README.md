Repository for PayPal's Node SDK (node.js version >=0.6.x) and Node samples for REST API. Refer [Node.js Sample Reference App ](https://github.com/paypal/rest-api-sample-app-nodejs) for a sample web app implementing the REST APIs.

> **v1.0.0 notice**: If upgrading from paypal rest sdk 0.*, Please view Breaking Changes in release_notes.md

> **Before starting to use the sdk, please be aware of the [existing issues and currently unavailable or upcoming features](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Python-SDK/wiki/Existing-Issues-and-Unavailable%5CUpcoming-features) for the REST APIs. (which the sdks are based on)** 

## Usage
To write an app using the SDK

  * Register for a developer account and get your client_id and secret at [PayPal Developer Portal](https://developer.paypal.com).
  * Add dependency 'paypal-rest-sdk' in your package.json file.
  * Require 'paypal-rest-sdk' in your file

    ```js
    var paypal = require('paypal-rest-sdk');
    ```
  * Create config options, with parameters (mode, client_id, secret).

    ```js
    paypal.configure({
      'mode': 'sandbox', //sandbox or live
      'client_id': 'EBWKjlELKMYqRNQ6sYvFo64FtaRLRR5BdHEESmha49TM',
      'client_secret': 'EO422dn3gQLgDbuwqTjzrFgFtaRLRR5BdHEESmha49TM'
    });
    ```
  * For multiple configuration support, have a look at the [sample](/samples/configuration/multiple_config.js)
  * Invoke the rest api (eg: store a credit card) with required parameters (eg: data, config_options, callback).

    ```js
    var card_data = {
      "type": "visa",
      "number": "4417119669820331",
      "expire_month": "11",
      "expire_year": "2018",
      "cvv2": "123",
      "first_name": "Joe",
      "last_name": "Shopper"
    };

    paypal.creditCard.create(card_data, function(error, credit_card){
      if (error) {
        console.log(error);
        throw error;
      } else {
        console.log("Create Credit-Card Response");
        console.log(credit_card);
      }
    })
    ```

  * For creating [Subscription Payments](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/create-billing-plan/), check out the [samples](/samples/subscription) for creating planned sets of future recurring payments at periodic intervals.

  * To create [Future Payments](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/mobile/make-future-payment/), check out this [sample](/samples/payment/create_future_payment.js) for executing future payments for a customer who has granted consent on a mobile device.

  * For [exploring additional payment capabilites](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/explore-payment-capabilities/), such as handling discounts, insurance, soft_descriptor and invoice_number, have a look at this [example](/samples/payment/create_with_paypal_further_capabilities.js). These bring REST payment functionality closer to parity with older Merchant APIs.

  * Customizing a [PayPal payment experience](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/integration/direct/rest-experience-overview/) is available as of version 1.1.0 enabling merchants to provide a customized experience to consumers from the merchantâ€™s website to the PayPal payment. Get started with the [supported rest methods](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/api/#payment-experience) and [samples](/samples/payment_experience/web_profile).

  * For creating and managing [Orders](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/integration/direct/create-process-order/#create-the-order), i.e. getting consent from buyer for a purchase but only placing the funds on hold when the merchant is ready to fulfill the [order](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/api/#orders), have a look at [samples](/samples/order).

  * For creating [batch and single payouts](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/integration/direct/payouts-overview/), check out the samples for [payouts](/samples/payout) and [payout items](/samples/payout_item). The [Payouts feature](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/api/#payouts) enables you to make PayPal payments to multiple PayPal accounts in a single API call.

  * For [Invoicing](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/api/#invoicing), check out the [samples](/samples/invoice/) to see how you can use the node sdk to create, send and manage invoices.

  * To receive [notifications from PayPal about Payment events](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/api/#notifications) on your server, webhook support is now available as of version 1.2.0. For creating and managing [Webhook and Webhook Events](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/integration/direct/rest-webhooks-overview/), check out the [samples](/samples/notifications/) to see how you can use the node sdk to manage webhooks, webhook events and [verify](/samples/notifications/webhook-events/webhook_payload_verify.js) that the response unaltered and is really from PayPal.

  * To use OpenID Connect

    ```js
    // OpenID configuration
    paypal.configure({
      'openid_client_id': 'CLIENT_ID',
      'openid_client_secret': 'CLIENT_SECRET',
      'openid_redirect_uri': 'http://example.com' });

    // Authorize url
    paypal.openIdConnect.authorizeUrl({'scope': 'openid profile'});

    // Get tokeninfo with Authorize code
    paypal.openIdConnect.tokeninfo.create("Replace with authorize code", function(error, tokeninfo){
      console.log(tokeninfo);
    });

    // Get tokeninfo with Refresh code
    paypal.openIdConnect.tokeninfo.refresh("Replace with refresh_token", function(error, tokeninfo){
      console.log(tokeninfo);
    });

    // Get userinfo with Access code
    paypal.openIdConnect.userinfo.get("Replace with access_code", function(error, userinfo){
      console.log(userinfo);
    });

    // Logout url
    paypal.openIdConnect.logoutUrl("Replace with tokeninfo.id_token");
    ```

## Running Samples
Instructions for running samples are located in the [sample directory](/samples). Try these samples in a live sandbox environment:

<a href="http://runnable.com/paypal" target="_blank"><img src="http://runnable.com/external/styles/assets/runnablebtn.png" style="width:67px;height:25px;"></a>

## Running Tests
To run the test suite first invoke the following command within the repo

If mocha is not installed
```sh
npm install -g mocha
```
and then to install the development dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```
then run the tests:
```sh
grunt test (timeout is specified in milliseconds eg: 15000ms)
```

## Debugging

   * It is recommended to provide Paypal-Debug-Id if requesting PayPal Merchant Technical Services for support. You can get access to the debug id by setting environment variable NODE_ENV=development
   * The error object returned for any bad request has error.response populated with [details](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/api/#errors)
